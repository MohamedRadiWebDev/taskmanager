## Getting Started

### Option 1: Direct File Access
1. Download all files to a folder
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start managing your tasks!

### Option 2: Local Web Server
For the best experience (especially for the truck SVG animations), serve the files through a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css       # All styles and animations
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js          # Main application logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ audio.js        # Audio management system
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ truck.svg       # Animated truck for swipe-to-delete

```

## Browser Compatibility

## Development Notes

This application was converted from a Flask-based backend to a pure frontend solution. All server-side functionality has been replaced with client-side equivalents:

- **Authentication**: Simple localStorage-based sessions
- **Data Persistence**: Browser localStorage instead of database
- **Real-time Updates**: JavaScript intervals for scheduled task checking

## Support

This is a standalone application with no external dependencies beyond standard web browser APIs. If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're using a modern web browser
2. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Clear localStorage if data becomes corrupted: `localStorage.clear()`
4. For best experience, serve files through a web server rather than file:// protocol
